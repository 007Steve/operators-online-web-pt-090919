# Operations

1. Use a if/else block to build a the `unsafe?` method that accepts a speed and returns either a 'safe' or 'unsafe' string based on whether the speed is either below 40 or above 60.

2. Use the ternary operator to build the method `not_safe?` that accepts the same parameter and also outputs the same strings as `unsafe?`.

3. Build a sum machine that takes two parameters and sums them together.

4. Given an array with nils in it output the squares of each element in the array and output 0 for any nil. You cannot use the method `#compact` but you should use the ||= operator.
