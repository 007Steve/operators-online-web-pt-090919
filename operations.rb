#use an if else statement to define whether the conditions are unsafe (speed is less than 40 or speed is greater than 60 )


#use a ternary operator to define whether the conditions are unsafe


#build a one line method named sum_machine that takes two args and returns the sum of all the numbers in between


#given the array
crazy_sauce = [nil, 2, 4, 5, 6, nil, 10]
#output the squares of each number. For nil output 0.
#You cannot use the method #compact but you should use the ||= operator
